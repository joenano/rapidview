GUI JSON viewer

For most cases, web based viewers are fine, but when working with large JSON files they become unresponsive or unusable and native performance is needed. I couldnt find a desktop app that I liked so I made this one. Its just a basic GUI view with [rapidjson](https://rapidjson.org/) backend.

I may add editing capabilities in future if there is any interest.
